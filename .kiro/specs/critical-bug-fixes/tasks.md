# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Investigate and fix photo data flow issues

  - Debug the currentPhoto$ observable in game component to ensure it emits valid photo data
  - Add logging to track photo data from store through to child components
  - Verify photo-map-toggle component receives non-null photo data
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.1, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 2. Fix photo display component rendering

  - Add null checks and loading states for when photo data is undefined
  - Implement error handling for failed image loads with retry functionality
  - Ensure photo component properly handles photo URL validation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.2, 4.5_

- [x] 3. Fix map component initialization and display

  - Debug map container availability and sizing issues
  - Add retry logic for map initialization failures
  - Ensure map component renders interactive map with pin placement capability
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.5, 4.3, 4.5_

- [x] 4. Correct game state progression logic

  - Fix the nextPhoto action in game reducer to increment currentPhotoIndex by exactly 1
  - Ensure photo index stays within bounds (0-4 for 5 photos)
  - Verify game effects properly sync currentPhoto when index changes
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 5. Fix photo counter display accuracy

  - Correct the game progress calculation to show accurate photo numbers
  - Ensure "Photo X of 5" displays current index + 1, not doubled values
  - Verify progress percentage calculation is accurate
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Fix navigation flow between game and results

  - Ensure clicking "Next Photo" advances to next game photo, not staying on results
  - Fix the onNextPhoto method to properly transition from results to game view
  - Verify game component properly handles the transition between photos
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 3.2_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive error handling and loading states

  - Implement loading states while photos are being fetched from API
  - Add error boundaries around photo and map components
  - Create fallback UI for when components fail to load
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 8. Test complete game flow and fix any remaining issues
  - Test game from start to finish with all 5 photos
  - Verify photo and map display throughout the game
  - Ensure accurate photo counting and navigation flow
  - Fix any edge cases or remaining bugs discovered during testing
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.5, 4.1_
