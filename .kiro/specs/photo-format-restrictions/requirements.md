# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The photo format restrictions feature ensures that only photos in web-compatible and reliably loadable formats are used in the Chronoscape game. This addresses issues where photos fail to load due to unsupported or problematic image formats, improving the overall user experience and game reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want all photos to load successfully, so that I can enjoy an uninterrupted gaming experience without encountering broken images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system fetches photos THEN it SHALL only select images in supported web formats
2. WHEN a photo is in an unsupported format THEN the system SHALL exclude it from selection
3. WHEN all photos in a game session are displayed THEN they SHALL load successfully without format-related errors
4. WHEN the system encounters a photo with an unknown format THEN it SHALL reject it and continue with other photos
5. IF no photos in acceptable formats are available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define a whitelist of acceptable image formats, so that the system only uses formats known to work reliably across different browsers and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring acceptable formats THEN the system SHALL support JPEG format
2. WHEN configuring acceptable formats THEN the system SHALL support PNG format
3. WHEN configuring acceptable formats THEN the system SHALL support WebP format for modern browsers
4. WHEN configuring acceptable formats THEN the system SHALL reject TIFF format due to limited browser support
5. WHEN configuring acceptable formats THEN the system SHALL reject SVG format as it's not suitable for photographs
6. WHEN configuring acceptable formats THEN the system SHALL reject GIF format to avoid animated content
7. WHEN a new format needs to be added THEN it SHALL be easily configurable through a centralized list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the photo filtering to validate both file extensions and MIME types, so that the system can accurately identify image formats regardless of how they're specified in the metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating photo format THEN the system SHALL check the file extension from the URL
2. WHEN validating photo format THEN the system SHALL check the MIME type from metadata if available
3. WHEN file extension and MIME type conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize MIME type validation
4. WHEN neither extension nor MIME type indicate a supported format THEN the system SHALL reject the photo
5. WHEN the system cannot determine the format THEN it SHALL err on the side of caution and reject the photo

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to provide fallback options when photos are rejected due to format issues, so that I can still play the game even if some photos are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN photos are rejected due to format restrictions THEN the system SHALL attempt to find alternative photos
2. WHEN insufficient photos pass format validation THEN the system SHALL retry with a larger initial pool
3. WHEN format validation reduces available photos below the required count THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message
4. WHEN displaying error messages THEN the system SHALL explain that photos were filtered for compatibility
5. IF format restrictions are too strict THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on potential solutions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging of format validation decisions, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot photo filtering issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a photo is rejected due to format THEN the system SHALL log the rejection reason with photo details
2. WHEN format validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL log the accepted format type
3. WHEN logging format decisions THEN the system SHALL include the photo URL and detected format
4. WHEN format validation fails unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
5. WHEN monitoring photo filtering THEN developers SHALL be able to identify common rejection patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want the format validation to be thoroughly tested, so that the system reliably filters photos and handles edge cases appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing format validation THEN the system SHALL correctly identify JPEG photos
2. WHEN testing format validation THEN the system SHALL correctly identify PNG photos
3. WHEN testing format validation THEN the system SHALL correctly reject TIFF photos
4. WHEN testing format validation THEN the system SHALL handle photos with missing format information
5. WHEN testing format validation THEN the system SHALL handle photos with malformed URLs
6. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle network errors during format detection
