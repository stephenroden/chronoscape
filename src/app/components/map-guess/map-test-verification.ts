/**
 * Verification checklist for manual testing:
 * 
 * 1. Map Container Availability:
 *    - Map should initialize properly when container is ready
 *    - Should show loading state while initializing
 *    - Should handle cases where container is not immediately available
 * 
 * 2. Retry Logic:
 *    - Should auto-retry when container/sizing issues occur
 *    - Should show retry attempt counter during auto-retry
 *    - Manual retry button should work when initialization fails
 *    - Should give up after 3 attempts and show appropriate error
 * 
 * 3. Interactive Map:
 *    - Map should be clickable for pin placement
 *    - Should show world view by default (latitude: 20, longitude: 0, zoom: 2)
 *    - Pin placement should work correctly
 *    - Map controls (center, zoom to pin, remove pin) should function
 * 
 * 4. Error Handling:
 *    - Should show appropriate error messages for different failure types
 *    - Should not break the entire game when map fails
 *    - Should provide retry options to users
 * 
 * 5. Toggle Container Mode:
 *    - Should work correctly when used in photo-map-toggle component
 *    - Should resize properly when container size changes
 *    - Should maintain state when switching between photo and map views
